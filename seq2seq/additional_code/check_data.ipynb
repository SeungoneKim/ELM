Certainly the dullest sci-fi book I own. The ONLY reason to read this one is because it's referenced from later works, in particular 1635 - The Dreeson Incident. You'd think that a character in a sci-fi novel should have a story at least as interesting as a normal person in real life - and this book sure misses that goal. Unless you're really, really keen on reading short children's stories about anthropomorphic rams (the sheep kind), this book is sure to disappoint.Skip this one - you'll thank me later.\"}\n"
